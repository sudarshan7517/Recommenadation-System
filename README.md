# Recommenadation-System

A machine learning algorithm known as a recommendation system combines information about users and products to forecast a user's potential interests. These systems are used in a wide range of applications, such as e-commerce, social media, and entertainment, to provide personalized recommendations to users.

There are several types of recommendation systems, including:

Content-based filtering: This type of system uses the characteristics of items that a user has liked in the past to recommend similar items.
Collaborative filtering: This type of system uses the past behaviour of users to recommend items that similar users have liked.
Hybrid: To generate suggestions, this kind of system combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques.
Matrix Factorization: Using this method, the user-item matrix is divided into two lower-dimension matrices that are then utilized to generate predictions.
Deep Learning: To train the user and item representations that are subsequently utilized to generate recommendations, these models make use of neural networks.
